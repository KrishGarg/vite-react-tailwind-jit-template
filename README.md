# Vite + ReactJs + TailwindCss in JIT Template

Just clone this repository or click the `Use This Template` button or use degit (`npx degit KrishGarg/vite-react-tailwind-jit-template#main`) to get a copy of this. Then just run `yarn` or `npm i` in the root of the folder to install all the dependencies. Then you can go ahead and start editing the src/App.jsx file and you can use tailwind throughout the entire app as the src/index.css file has registered tailwind and it is imported in the main.jsx file.
